"""
You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is 
the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose 
any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have 
weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of 
weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. 
If there are no stones left, return 0.
